When I was halfway building SuperPy I asked myself the question “Would I actually use this if I were in retail?” and the answer was no, obviously. So I asked myself what I would like SuperPy to be like if I was managing my own shop. I decided I probably would not want to use a command line based program, but rather something that looked a bit more user friendly. I had a vague memory of the term “Tkinter” so I decided to dive into that and learn more about how to use that. 
What problem does it solve: having to type all commands all the time and memorizing the different options. 
Why did I chose to do it this way: I figured by providing a user interface, the program could ask for direct instructions, thereby limiting the possible error from the user and only asking what is necessary for the action that is being taken. One example is the use of a list to show all items eligible for sale, thereby limiting the room for error by the user (typing the name of a product that is not in stock, or making a typo). For the use of the program via the command line I wrote a response along the lines of “Item not in stock”, but then the user had already gone through the effort of typing a name and price. 
While building the main functionalities there were many tiny things I came across that could theoretically face a problem that I wanted to overcome. Like “how many days are in a month?”, taking into account different months and leap years. Fixed that by looping through the days until the program had to ‘digitally flip the page on the bathroom calendar’ because a new month had started. 
I found that while looking for a way to implement the basic functionalities, the methods that I chose opened up new possibilities for functionalities a user might like. For example the possibility to change the system date to a certain date, instead of just advance with n days, or the possibility to specify a certain period for which to display profit or revenue: the function and code already provided for that, and I can image a shop owner would like these options. Also include the option to visualize the profit and revenue. I chose to limit that (for now) to just last week, to get a sense of how it works and what it can do.
